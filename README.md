During the Acquisition process it is important for lenders to identify which factors are responsible for accounts being bad. Detailed analysis and modelling of bad accounts will help lenders in account management programs or change account acquisition strategies to minimize credit loss in future. The intended goal is to classify accounts who have a higher probability of going delinquent or default over a period of time. The objective is to build a classification model to predict which customers are likely to default and give recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.

Problem Formulation:
A bank's consumer credit department aims to simplify the decision-making process for home equity lines of credit to be accepted. To do this, they will adopt the Equal Credit Opportunity Act's guidelines to establish an empirically derived and statistically sound model for credit scoring. The model will be based on recently approved applicants, given sufficient time to go bad, based on current acquisition strategy.
